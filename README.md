Playbook /home/bob/playbooks/nameserver.yaml attempts to add an entry in /etc/resolv.conf file to add a new nameserver.


The first task in the playbook is using the shell module to display the existing contents of /etc/resolv.conf file and the second one is adding a new line containing the name server details into the file. However, when this playbook is run multiple times, it keeps adding new entries of same line into the resolv.conf file. To resolve this issue, update the playbook as per details mentioned below.


Add a register directive to store the output of the first task to a variable called command_output

Then add a conditional to the second task to check if the output already contains the name server (10.0.250.10). Use command_output.stdout.find(<IP>) == -1


Note:
a. A better way to do this would be to use the lineinfile module. This is just for practice.


b.shell and command modules are similar in a way that they are used to execute a command on the system. However, shell executes the command inside a shell giving us access to environment variables and redirection using >>.
